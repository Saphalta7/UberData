# UberData

In this project, I  did Uber Data Analysis using different tools and technologies. I stored the data in AWS then used Python and Compute Instance to handle the calculations. The Mage Data Pipeline Tool helped me organize and move the data around efficiently. BigQuery, another tool, allowed me to ask complex questions and get quick answers from the data. So, I used a combination of these tools to analyze Uber data and gain insights in a more effective and organized way.
